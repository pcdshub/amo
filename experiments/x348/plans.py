    Parameters
    ----------
    palette : experiments.x348.devices.McgranePalette
        Pallette object w/ motors and math modules. This is an ophyd object
        representing the mobile target-holding device. This plan presumes that
        the palette object has already been calibrated externally.

    sequencer : 
        Ophyd object for controlling LCLS sequencer. In burst mode this object
        allows sequences of shots to be called on demand. 

    first_target : int 
        Index of the first target on the sample to be struck by the beam. This
        is inclusive such that if this argument is 5, sample No. 5 will be the
        first sample to receive beam.

    last_target : int or None.
        Index of the last target on the sample to be struck. This is exclusive
        such that if this argument is 5, sample No. 5 will NOT receive beam.
        Presuming that the indexes are in positive order (first target <
        last_target), No. 4 will be the last to receive beam. In the event that
        this is None, only the first_target will be scanned. Defaults to None.

    sequencer_delay : float or None
        A delay time to wait after each sequencer run. This may be necessary if
        the sequencer start command does not block until the sequence's
        completion. Defaults to None

    use_sequencer : bool
        Set to False to disable the sequencer. Intended for debugging only
        Defaults to True.
